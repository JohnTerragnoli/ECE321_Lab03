#Section 1

##Objective:

The purpose of Section 1 is to create a binary inverter using a CMOS circuit.  Characteristics on the VTC curve and regarding time delays will be measured in simulation and with actual hardware parts.  

##Theory

Done: 
Talk about how transistors work.  
Difference between PMOS and NMOS.
pull up/down networks


Add in: 
VTC
noise margins

maximum useable frequency
power dissipation
capacitor load sizes effects
frequency really low (current meter)
sinusoidal frequency instead of binary?
effects on ground when switching.  
large capacitor between Vdd and ground. 



Equations?
